# Danymat's pentest box

## Disclaimer

Hello ! This project is a personal hacking lab that i use to quickly spin and replicate my environment. It currently uses vmware fusion because i'm on Mac.

## Prerequisites

- Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
- Vmware Fusion (https://www.vmware.com/fr/products/fusion.html)

## Run

- `vagrant up`
- `vagrant ssh`

If you explore the Vagrantfile, you'll see that I created a socks proxy when booting up ssh.
This is useful for doing hackthebox machines and wanting to have Burp on my host machine. I just need to enable socks on burp and voila.
